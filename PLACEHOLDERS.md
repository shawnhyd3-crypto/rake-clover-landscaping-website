# Placeholders to Update (Rake & Clover)

This file tracks temporary placeholders we need to replace once Jon provides real assets/links and Jobber is connected.

## Links
- Google reviews link is a placeholder:
  - Current: `https://g.co/kgs/placeholder`
  - Replace with: real Google reviews URL
- Social links in footer are placeholders (`href="#"`):
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Google / Reviews
- Client portal placeholder:
  - `portal.html` exists and homepage banner links to it
  - Replace with: Jobber client portal URL (or embed)

## Jobber integration
- Booking is currently a **mailto fallback** (homepage + contact page) until Jobber is ready.
  - Replace with: Jobber booking widget/link.

## Images
These are still stock/temporary (ok for now):
- Unsplash hero background (homepage)
- Some Unsplash/stock images across About/Service Area sections
- Gallery page says “Photos Coming Soon”

## Content / cleanup
- Testimonials appear to be template text (needs real customer reviews)
- Some copy still references “free quote” vs “booking” inconsistently (review once Jon confirms preferred wording)
